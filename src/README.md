# Source Code Directory

This directory contains the source code for the project, primarily in the form of Python scripts (`.py` files).

## Structure

The code should be organized into logical modules. For example:

-   `data_processing.py`: Scripts for loading, cleaning, and preprocessing data.
-   `analysis.py`: Scripts for running the quantitative analysis and statistical tests.
-   `utils.py`: Helper functions used across multiple scripts.

This separation helps maintain clean, reusable, and testable code.
