## Summary of Feedback

### Strengths

-   **Innovative Concept**: The core idea of using next-generation LLMs for MRI interpretation is timely and innovative.
-   **Methodological Transparency**: The description of the interaction and workflow is clear and provides a good foundation for future work.
-   **Ethical Framework**: The emphasis on ethical AI and data transparency is a commendable and crucial aspect of the study.

### Areas for Major Revision

-   **Lack of Generalizability**: A single case study is insufficient to draw any generalizable conclusions. The study must be expanded to a larger, more diverse cohort.
-   **Missing Comparative Analysis**: A direct, quantitative comparison against existing standards (human radiologists) and previous AI models (e.g., GPT-4 Vision) is essential.
-   **Statistical Rigor**: The study needs statistical analysis to validate its claims.
-   **Formal Ethics Approval**: A formal statement regarding Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval is mandatory.

### Conclusion

The work is a promising proof-of-concept but does not yet meet the standards for a full research article in a high-impact journal.

**Recommendation**: **Major Revision**
