# Notebooks Directory

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks used for exploratory data analysis, visualization, model interaction, and results generation.

## Usage

Each notebook should be self-contained and clearly documented. It's recommended to run them in a virtual environment with the dependencies specified in a `requirements.txt` file (to be added in the root directory).

### Naming Convention

Notebooks should be named descriptively, for example:
- `01_data_exploration.ipynb`
- `02_quantitative_analysis.ipynb`
- `03_figure_generation.ipynb`
