## 📌 Project Overview

This repository contains the data, code, and resources for the research project investigating the role of large language models, specifically ChatGPT-5, in the interpretation of lumbar spine MRI scans. The study follows a multidisciplinary case study approach, documenting the entire research lifecycle from preprint to major revision.

Our goal is to demonstrate a reproducible **Human-AI diagnostic workflow** built upon a foundation of transparent and ethical AI frameworks.

###  статусы (Status)

-   **Current Stage**: Major Revision
-   **Feedback Source**: AI-driven peer review from Gemini 2.5 and GPT-5, simulating evaluation for Q1 journals.
-   **Key Feedback**: While novelty and ethical clarity were praised, the reviews highlighted the need for a larger sample size, quantitative metrics, and a formal ethics statement.

---

## 🔬 Action Plan (Major Revision)

To address the feedback and strengthen the manuscript for journal submission, the following steps are planned:

-   [ ] **Expand Dataset**: Increase sample size to 10–20 lumbar MRI cases.
-   [ ] **Add Quantitative Evaluation**: Implement and report metrics like sensitivity, specificity, and the kappa (κ) value.
-   [ ] **Add Visual Comparison**: Create figures comparing interpretations from a Radiologist, ChatGPT-5, and GPT-4 Vision.
-   [ ] **Insert Ethics Statement**: Add a formal Ethics/IRB statement with the relevant ID.
-   [ ] **Update Abstract**: Revise the abstract to clearly state the "single-case limitation" of the initial work.
-   [ ] **Prepare Rebuttal Letter**: Draft a comprehensive response to the points raised during the peer review simulation.

### 🎯 Goal & Timeline

-   **Target Journals**: *Scientific Reports*, *AI in Medicine*, *Diagnostics*
-   **Expected Submission Window**: Q1 2026

> **Personal Note**: This stage taught me how AI feedback can mirror real peer review — rigorous, structured, and even philosophical at times. I see this as part of a bigger vision: promoting transparent, ethical, and human-centered AI research from independent labs like mine.
