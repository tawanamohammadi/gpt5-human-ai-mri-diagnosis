# Data Directory

This directory is intended to store the anonymized datasets used in the research, specifically the lumbar MRI cases.

## Important Note

Due to patient privacy and data sensitivity, the raw DICOM files will not be made publicly available in this repository. 

This directory will contain:
- Anonymized, processed data representations.
- A data dictionary explaining the features.
- Scripts used for data anonymization and preprocessing (if applicable).

Please refer to the manuscript for a detailed description of the data collection and anonymization process.
